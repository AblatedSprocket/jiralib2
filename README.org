* JIRA REST API bindings to elisp

This is the backend used by Ejira, which is now pulled out into its own package.

| Jiralib2 is developed against a JIRA Server instance, not a JIRA cloud instance. This is the case simply because our company is using a self-hosted JIRA and that is what I develop against. Contributions for evaluating and/or making this work with a JIRA Cloud setup would be greatly appreciated.

** Basic configuration
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package jiralib2
    :init
    (setq jiralib2-url             "https://jira.mycorp.com"
          jiralib2-user-login-name "my-jira-username"))
#+END_SRC
** Commands

** Troubleshooting
- Login with =jiralib2-session-login= works, but all session calls return 401.
    - Try setting =request--curl-cookie-jar= to an empty string =(setq request--curl-cookie-jar "")=. This solved the issue for me with a Linux laptop running curl 7.62.0. My Macbook Pro running curl 7.54.0 did not require this. Maybe a bug in curl?
